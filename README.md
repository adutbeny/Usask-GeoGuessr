# cmpt370 SWAGTOWN

## Important:
IntelliJ doesn't let you work out of the main branch, so keep all of the work in the master branch, then everytime we hit like a certain checkpoint, we can merge back a good copy into the main branch. Once we have more things going on we can worry about working within our own branches and whatnot.

I left the default readme in case anyone needs the info.

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.cs.usask.ca/jxa417/cmpt370.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git.cs.usask.ca/jxa417/cmpt370/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
